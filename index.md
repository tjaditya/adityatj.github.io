Aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer**, with interests in:

- **Vehicle design and aerodynamics** (CFD, car design)
- **Robotics and IoT** (Raspberry Pi, autonomous systems)
- **Computational physics and programming** (Python, MITx 6.00.1x / 6.00.2x)
- **Photography and travel**

I’m currently working on:

- A **Raspberry Pi–based autonomous rover** implementing LKA, ACC, and AEB  
- A **CFD-based car aerodynamics pipeline**, extending my IED Turin car design into a clean, watertight 3D model for simulation using Blender → cfMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView
 
This site showcases my projects, coursework, photography, and learning experiences during my break year as I prepare for undergraduate studies in **Mechanical Engineering and Robotics**.
