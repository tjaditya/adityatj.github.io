Aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer** from India with interests in:

- **Vehicle design and aerodynamics** (CFD, car design)
- **Robotics and IoT** (Raspberry Pi, autonomous systems)
- **Computational physics and programming** (Python, MITx 6.00.1x / 6.00.2x)
- **Photography and travel**

I’m currently working on:

- A **Raspberry Pi–based autonomous rover** implementing LKA, ACC, and AEB  
- A **CFD car aerodynamics pipeline** using Blender → cfMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView  
- Extending my **IED Turin car design project** into a full 3D CAD + aerodynamics model  

This site showcases my projects, coursework, photography, and travelogue during my break year as I prepare for undergraduate studies in **Mechanical Engineering** and **Robotics**.
