I am an **engineering-focused student** working at the intersection of  
**physics, computation, and hands-on prototyping** to explore real-world
mechanical and robotic systems.

My primary areas of interest include:

- **Vehicle design and aerodynamics**, with emphasis on geometry development,
  validation, CFD analysis, and physical prototyping
- **Robotics and embedded systems**, with a focus on autonomous ground vehicles
- **Computational physics and programming** (Python; MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x)
- **Photography and travel**, as tools for observation and visual reasoning

Current engineering work includes:

- A **CFD-based car aerodynamics pipeline** that extends a vehicle concept
  developed during an on-site design studio at IED Turin into:
  - a clean, simulation-ready 3D geometry, and
  - an end-to-end workflow using **Blender → snappyHexMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView**,
  with **digital-to-physical validation through iterative 3D printing**
- A **Raspberry Pi–based autonomous rover**, focused on simulating and analyzing
  the behavior of Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC),
  and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)

This site documents selected engineering projects, coursework, and independent
learning undertaken during a **deliberate, purposeful break year**, as I prepare
for undergraduate studies in **Mechanical Engineering and Robotics**.
