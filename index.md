I am an **engineering-focused student** working at the intersection of  
**physics, computation, and hands-on prototyping**, with an emphasis on
understanding and validating real-world mechanical and robotic systems.

My primary areas of interest include:

- **Vehicle design and aerodynamics**, with emphasis on geometry development,
  simulation-driven validation, CFD analysis, and physical prototyping
- **Robotics and embedded systems**, with a focus on simulation-first,
  safety-aware development for autonomous ground vehicles
- **Computational physics and programming** (Python; MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x),
  applied to modeling, analysis, and system behavior
- **Photography and travel**, used as tools for observation, documentation,
  and visual reasoning

Current engineering work includes:

- A **CFD-based vehicle aerodynamics pipeline** that extends a vehicle concept
  developed during an on-site design studio at IED Turin into:
  - a clean, simulation-ready 3D geometry, and  
  - an end-to-end workflow using **Blender → snappyHexMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView**,  
    additionally validated through **digital-to-physical iteration using 3D printing**
- A **Raspberry Pi–based ADAS simulation and experimentation platform**, focused on
  scenario-driven analysis of **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**,  
  **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**, and **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)**,
  with emphasis on system behavior, feature interaction, and observability

This site documents selected engineering projects, coursework, and independent
learning undertaken during a **deliberate, purposeful break year**, as I prepare
for undergraduate studies in **Mechanical Engineering and Robotics**.
