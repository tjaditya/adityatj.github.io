Aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer** with a strong interest in applying
**physics, computation, and hands-on prototyping** to real-world engineering problems.

My primary areas of focus include:

- **Vehicle design and aerodynamics**, with emphasis on geometry development,
  CFD analysis, and physical prototyping
- **Robotics and embedded systems**, with interest in autonomous ground vehicles
- **Computational physics and programming** (Python, MITx 6.00.1x and 6.00.2x)
- **Photography and travel**, as tools for observation and visual thinking

I am currently working on:

- A **CFD-based car aerodynamics pipeline**, extending my IED Turin car design into
  a clean, watertight 3D geometry and an end-to-end simulation workflow using  
  Blender → snappyHexMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView, including
  **digital-to-physical validation through 3D printing**
- A **Raspberry Pi–based autonomous rover**, implementing Lane Keeping Assist (LKA),
  Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)

This site documents my engineering projects, coursework, and learning experiences
during a purposeful break year as I prepare for undergraduate studies in
**Mechanical Engineering and Robotics**.
