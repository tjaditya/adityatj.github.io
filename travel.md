## Europe Travelogue

During my Europe trip, I documented my experiences, especially around:

- Design and engineering museums
- Automotive museums and galleries
- Cityscapes and everyday life

### Posts

- **[Day 1 – Arrival & First Impressions](#)** *(coming soon)*
- **[Design School Visits](#)*
- **[Museums & Engineering Inspiration](#)**

I’ll gradually publish day-wise or theme-wise posts here, focusing on what I learnt and observed as an aspiring engineer.
