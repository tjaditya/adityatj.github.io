## Context

In summer 2025, alongside my **car design coursework at IED Turin**, I spent time across
multiple European cities.  

This period provided exposure not only to academic studio environments, but also to
**automotive history, design culture, and real-world engineering contexts** that shaped
how I now think about design and problem-solving.

Rather than a day-by-day travel diary, this page highlights a few **learning-oriented
takeaways** from that experience.

## Design & Engineering Perspective

During this journey, I engaged with automotive spaces where **design intent, engineering
constraints, and manufacturing realities intersect**.

Key influences included:

- Studio-based learning and critiques at **IED Turin**
- Visits to automotive museums and design spaces in Italy and Europe
- Exposure to performance vehicles, restoration work, and motorsport heritage
- Observing how form, function, and constraints coexist in real vehicles

These experiences reinforced the importance of **engineering-aware design**, which now
directly informs my work in **CFD-based car modeling and prototyping**.

## Personal Growth & Reflection

Living independently in a new country and navigating unfamiliar environments helped me
develop adaptability, confidence, and clarity in my interests.

This experience strengthened my motivation to pursue **mechanical engineering and
robotics**, combining analytical rigor with design intuition.

## Optional: Personal Travel Journal (WIP)

For personal documentation, I maintain a detailed travel journal capturing daily
experiences and reflections.
