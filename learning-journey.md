## Context

This page captures reflective context from my break year following high school, during which I intentionally stepped beyond a classroom-only learning path to gain exposure to real-world design processes, engineering workflows, and independent technical exploration.

Rather than documenting events chronologically, this page highlights how specific experiences shaped my thinking as an aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer** and influenced the direction of my current project work.

## From Design Exposure to Engineering Direction

My academic engagement at **IED Turin** provided an early introduction to the complete workflow of exterior car design — from ideation and sketching to physical clay modeling and digital refinement.

Working through these stages helped me understand how early design decisions affect downstream feasibility, particularly in terms of:
- Surface continuity  
- Manufacturability  
- Translating visual intent into physically realizable geometry  

This exposure directly influenced my decision to extend the IED concept into an independent **CFD-ready car geometry project**, where design modeling is evaluated through engineering constraints such as mesh quality, boundary conditions, and simulation stability.

## Independent Learning & Project Mindset

Alongside formal coursework, this period reinforced the importance of **self-driven learning** and structured experimentation.

Navigating unfamiliar environments, adapting to new tools, and working with limited guidance strengthened my ability to:
- Learn independently  
- Ask better technical questions  
- Reflect critically on my own work  
- Document progress methodically  

These habits now shape how I approach engineering projects, including my work on CFD pipelines, robotics systems, and embedded software.

## Closing Note

This learning journey complements the technical projects presented on this site by providing context for how my interests, approach to problem-solving, and engineering focus have evolved.

My primary work is documented in the **Projects** section, where each project is presented with clear objectives, technical depth, and ongoing learning outcomes.
