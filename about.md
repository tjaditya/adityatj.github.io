## Current Focus (Break Year)

I am using my break year to build engineering depth through project-based learning and real-world workflows.

### 🔧 Engineering & Design Projects
- **CFD-based Car Aerodynamics Pipeline**  
  Blender → cfMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView  
  (Extending my IED Turin concept design into a full CFD and 3D-printable model)

- **Autonomous Rover (Raspberry Pi)**  
  Implementing **LKA, ACC, and AEB**, along with sensor fusion and real-time control algorithms  

### 💻 Technical Skills I’m Developing
- Linux fundamentals & shell-based workflows  
- Git/GitHub and version control  
- Python for simulation and automation  
- Robotics & embedded systems programming

## Visual Studies (Sketchbook)

Alongside engineering and robotics, I maintain a small sketchbook focused on shading, perspective, and form studies.  
These exercises support my work in car modeling, aerodynamics, and concept development.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This site is a living record of my learning journey — combining:

- Mechanical design  
- Robotics  
- Computational physics  
- Programming  
- Visual studies  
- Photography and travel documentation  

I am continuously updating it as I make progress on projects, experiments, and university preparation.
