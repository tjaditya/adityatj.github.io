# About Me

I’m **Aditya Jaikish Thamarasseril**, an aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer** with a strong interest in vehicle aerodynamics, computational design, robotics, and embedded systems.

I am particularly drawn to engineering problems that lie at the intersection of **physics, computation, and real-world constraints**—where modeling, simulation, and experimentation inform each other. I enjoy working through complete engineering workflows, from early-stage concept development to implementation, validation, and iteration.

I completed my schooling in India and am currently in a **purposeful break year**, focused on building engineering depth through hands-on projects, advanced coursework, and self-directed technical exploration.

## Break Year Focus

My break year is centered on **project-based engineering**, where I deliberately work through full technical pipelines—concept definition, modeling, simulation, debugging, and interpretation—rather than isolated exercises.

### 🔧 Engineering & Design Projects

- **Vehicle Concept Design – IED Turin (Onsite Summer Program)**  
  Completed an intensive **three-week onsite program** in Turin focused on automotive concept development, proportion, surfacing, and design thinking.  
  Developed an original car concept through iterative sketching, package studies, and form exploration under faculty guidance.  
  This work later served as the design foundation for an independent computational aerodynamics project.

- **CFD-Based Car Aerodynamics Pipeline**  
  *Blender → snappyHexMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView*  
  Extended an earlier vehicle concept into a **CFD-ready external geometry** and a complete open-source simulation workflow.  
  This project focused on geometry preparation, mesh quality, solver convergence, and **qualitative analysis of velocity, pressure, and wake structure**, supported by physical validation through 3D-printed prototypes.  
  The current phase establishes a **repeatable baseline pipeline**, intentionally prioritizing robustness and interpretability over performance optimization.

- **Autonomous Rover for ADAS Simulation (Raspberry Pi)**  
  Developing a **simulation-first platform** for exploring **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** concepts, including **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**, **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**, and **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)**.  
  Emphasis is placed on scenario-based simulation, system behavior analysis, sensor abstraction, and controlled transition from simulated logic to embedded execution.

### 💻 Tools & Workflows I Actively Use
- Linux-based development environments  
- Git & GitHub for version control and technical documentation  
- Python for simulation, automation, and data handling  
- Fundamentals of embedded systems and robotics programming

---

## Visual Studies (Sketchbook)

Alongside engineering, I maintain a small sketchbook focused on **form, perspective, and shading**.  
These studies support my work in vehicle modeling, aerodynamic surfaces, spatial reasoning, and concept development.

## Documentation & Tooling Note

AI-assisted writing tools were used selectively to support the **structure and clarity of documentation** on this site and in select project repositories.

All engineering work—including modeling, simulation setup, numerical analysis, and implementation—was performed independently, with technical decisions guided by physical reasoning and validation through results.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This site is a curated record of my learning journey, bringing together:

- Mechanical design  
- Robotics & embedded systems  
- Computational physics and simulation  
- Programming  
- Visual studies  
- Photography and travel documentation  

I update it as projects mature and new technical insights are gained.
