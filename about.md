# About Me

I’m **Aditya Jaikish Thamarasseril**, an aspiring **Mechanical & Robotics Engineer** with a strong interest in vehicle aerodynamics, computational design, robotics, and embedded systems.

I am particularly drawn to engineering problems that lie at the intersection of **physics, computation, and real-world constraints**—where modeling, simulation, and experimentation inform each other. I enjoy working through complete engineering workflows, from early-stage concept development to implementation, validation, and iteration.

I completed my schooling in India and am currently in a **purposeful break year**, focused on building engineering depth through hands-on projects, advanced coursework, and self-directed technical exploration.

## Break Year Focus

My break year is centered on **project-based engineering**, where I deliberately work through full technical pipelines—concept definition, modeling, simulation, debugging, and interpretation—rather than isolated exercises.

### 🔧 Engineering & Design Projects

- **Vehicle Concept Design – IED Turin (Onsite Summer Program)**  
  Completed an intensive **three-week onsite program** in Turin focused on automotive concept development, proportion, surfacing, and design thinking.  
  Developed an original car concept through iterative sketching, package studies, and form exploration under faculty guidance.  
  This project later became the foundation for my independent computational aerodynamics and simulation work.

- **CFD-Based Car Aerodynamics Pipeline**  
  *Blender → snappyHexMesh → OpenFOAM → ParaView*  
  Extending an earlier vehicle concept into a fully simulated aerodynamic model.  
  Focus areas include geometry cleanup, mesh quality, boundary condition setup, solver behavior, and interpretation of pressure, velocity, and force coefficients.  
  Planned extensions include iterative design refinement and 3D-printable components.

- **Autonomous Rover (Raspberry Pi)**  
  Designing and implementing **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**, **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**, and **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)** concepts.  
  Emphasis is on simulation-backed development, sensor integration, control logic, real-time decision making, and reliable embedded system behavior.

### 💻 Tools & Workflows I Actively Use
- Linux-based development environments  
- Git & GitHub for version control and documentation  
- Python for simulation, automation, and data handling  
- Embedded systems and robotics programming fundamentals

## Learning Context

A short reflective overview of how my academic exposure and independent work shaped my current engineering direction is available here:

## Visual Studies (Sketchbook)

Alongside engineering, I maintain a small sketchbook focused on **form, perspective, and shading**.  
These studies support my work in vehicle modeling, aerodynamic surfaces, spatial reasoning, and concept development.

## Documentation & Tooling Note

AI-assisted writing tools were used selectively to help structure and refine the **documentation and presentation** on this site and in select project repositories.

All engineering work—including modeling, simulation setup, numerical analysis, and implementation—was performed independently, with design and technical decisions driven by physical reasoning and validation through results.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This site is a living record of my learning journey, bringing together:

- Mechanical design  
- Robotics & embedded systems  
- Computational physics and simulation  
- Programming  
- Visual studies  
- Photography and travel documentation  

I update it continuously as my projects evolve and my understanding deepens.
