## Featured Projects

### 1. Car 3D Print – Concept to Prototype
**Repo:** [car-3dprint](https://github.com/tjaditya/car-3dprint)

A project to take an original car body design and prepare it for **3D printing**, focusing on:

- Surface cleanup and thickening in Blender
- Splitting the model into printable parts
- Tolerances and supports for FDM printing

*(Content coming soon: design notes, STL files, photos of the printed model.)*

---

### 2. IED Car Design Summer School Project
**Repo:** [ied-cardesign](https://github.com/tjaditya/ied-cardesign)

Developed during a **3-week onsite summer course at IED Turin**:

- Initial sketching and proportions
- 3D modelling of the exterior
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

Planned extensions:

- Convert the IED model to a watertight 3D CAD/mesh model
- Run aerodynamic analysis using cfMesh + OpenFOAM + ParaView

---

### 3. Raspberry Pi Autonomous Rover *(in progress)*
**Repo (planned):** `raspi-rover` (coming soon)

Implementing:

- Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)

Focus areas: sensor fusion, control algorithms, and robust embedded software.

---

### 4. CFD Pipeline for Car Aerodynamics *(in progress)*

- Blender modelling → mesh generation using **cfMesh**
- Simulation with **OpenFOAM**
- Post-processing in **ParaView**

Will include: scenarios, meshes, simulation cases, and comparison plots.
