### 1. Concept Car Geometry Development & CFD Pipeline Implementation

**Domain:** Automotive Design & Aerodynamics  
**Tools:** Blender · snappyHexMesh · OpenFOAM · ParaView  
**Status:** Phase 1 complete

A self-driven follow-up project extending my **IED Turin car design work** into a
complete **open-source CFD pipeline**.

The project focuses on taking an early-stage concept car design through
**geometry refinement, meshing, solver setup, and convergence**, with emphasis on
engineering-aware modeling and numerical stability rather than visual styling alone.

**Focus areas**

- Surface continuity and mesh-aware modeling in Blender  
- Preparation of CFD-suitable, watertight geometry  
- Unstructured hex-dominant meshing using **snappyHexMesh**  
- Steady-state external aerodynamics using **OpenFOAM (simpleFoam)**  
- Flow visualization and qualitative interpretation in **ParaView**

### 2. IED Turin – Car Design Summer Course

In summer 2025, I attended a **3-week onsite car design course at  
Istituto Europeo di Design (IED), Turin**.

The program focused on the complete exterior car design workflow — from sketching
and proportion studies to a physical clay model.

**Course highlights**

- Studio sessions on proportions, stance, and surface language  
- Iterative sketching with one-to-one faculty feedback  
- Translating concepts into a physical clay model  
- Classroom sessions on automotive design trends  

**What I did**

- Developed an original exterior concept for a compact performance car  
- Created side, front, and rear views exploring surface treatments  
- Built a digital version of the selected concept in Photoshop  
- Built a clay model using the course tools and workflow  
- Presented the final design to faculty and peers  

**Industry Exposure (Exclusive Garage Visits)**  
Alongside studio coursework, I visited several **private and specialist automotive garages**
in and around Turin, gaining exposure to:

- Performance vehicle restoration and custom tuning  
- Fabrication techniques for bodywork and aerodynamic components  
- Motorsport-influenced modification processes  
- High-precision finishing and detailing  

These visits helped bridge the gap between **design intent** and
**real-world build constraints**.

### 3. Car 3D Print – Concept to Prototype *(planned)*

A project focused on converting a car body design into a **3D-printable prototype**.

Planned work includes:

- Surface cleanup and wall-thickness control in Blender  
- Splitting the model into printable sections  
- Managing tolerances and supports for FDM printing  

*(Design notes, STL files, and photos of the printed model will be added.)*

### 4. Raspberry Pi Autonomous Rover *(in progress)*

A hands-on robotics project focused on building an **autonomous ground rover**
using Raspberry Pi.

Planned and ongoing work includes:

- **Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)**  
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**  
- **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)**  

Focus areas include sensor integration, control logic, and robust embedded software
development.

More projects and detailed write-ups will be added over time as I continue to expand
my engineering and design work.
