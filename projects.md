### 1. Concept Car Geometry Development and CFD Pipeline Implementation

**Domain:** Automotive Design and Aerodynamics  
**Tools:** Blender, snappyHexMesh, OpenFOAM, ParaView  
**Status:** Phase 1 complete

A self-driven follow-up project extending my **IED Turin car design work** into a complete  
**design–simulation–physical prototyping pipeline**, built entirely using open-source tools.

The project focuses on taking an early-stage concept car design through
**geometry refinement, meshing, solver setup, convergence, and validation**, with emphasis on
engineering-aware modeling, numerical stability, and iteration rather than visual styling alone.

**Focus areas**

- Surface continuity and mesh-aware modeling in Blender  
- Preparation of CFD-suitable, watertight external geometry  
- Unstructured hex-dominant meshing using snappyHexMesh  
- Steady-state external aerodynamics using OpenFOAM (simpleFoam)  
- Flow visualization and qualitative interpretation in ParaView  
- Physical prototyping through 3D printing and feedback-driven geometry iteration

### 2. IED Turin – Automotive Concept Design (Onsite Summer Program)

In summer 2025, I attended a **three-week onsite automotive design program** at  
**Istituto Europeo di Design (IED), Turin**.

The course focused on the complete exterior car design workflow, from sketching and proportion
studies to physical model development.

This project laid the **design foundation** for my later computational aerodynamics,
geometry refinement, and physical prototyping work.

**Course highlights**

- Studio sessions on proportions, stance, and surface language  
- Iterative sketching with one-to-one faculty feedback  
- Translating concepts into a physical clay model  
- Classroom sessions on automotive design trends  

**My work during the course**

- Developed an original exterior concept for a compact performance car  
- Created side, front, and rear views exploring surface treatments  
- Built a digital version of the selected concept for refinement  
- Constructed a physical clay model using the course workflow  
- Presented the final design to faculty and peers  

**Industry Exposure (Garage Visits)**

Alongside studio coursework, I visited several private and specialist automotive garages
in and around Turin, gaining exposure to:

- Performance vehicle restoration and custom tuning  
- Fabrication techniques for bodywork and aerodynamic components  
- Motorsport-influenced modification processes  
- High-precision finishing and detailing  

These visits helped bridge the gap between **design intent** and **real-world build constraints**.

### 3. ADAS Simulation and Deployment Platform using Raspberry Pi (In Progress)

An engineering-focused robotics project aimed at building a **modular simulation and deployment
platform** for **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** concepts.

Rather than starting with a fully autonomous rover, this project follows an
**infrastructure-first approach**, where ADAS algorithms are:

- developed and validated on a laptop using simulation and replayable data,
- tested through clean hardware-agnostic interfaces, and
- incrementally deployed onto a Raspberry Pi–based rover only after verification.

The emphasis is on **system architecture, correctness, and safety-aware development**, mirroring
real-world automotive and robotics workflows.

**Target ADAS capabilities (to be developed incrementally)**

- Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)  
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)  
- Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)  

**Core focus areas**

- Hardware abstraction and mock sensor interfaces  
- Laptop-based simulation and algorithm validation  
- Real-time sensing and control on Raspberry Pi  
- Controlled transition from simulation to hardware execution  
- Embedded software structure, safety constraints, and observability  

This project serves as a **testbed for embedded systems, robotics, and ADAS-oriented system design**,
with features introduced only after validation in a controlled environment.

More projects and detailed write-ups will be added over time as I continue to expand
my engineering and design work.
