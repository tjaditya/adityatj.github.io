## Featured Projects

### 1. Car 3D Print – Concept to Prototype
**Repo:** [car-3dprint](https://github.com/tjaditya/car-3dprint)

A project to take an original car body design and prepare it for **3D printing**, focusing on:

- Surface cleanup and thickening in Blender
- Splitting the model into printable parts
- Tolerances and supports for FDM printing

*(Content coming soon: design notes, STL files, photos of the printed model.)*

## 2. IED Turin – Car Design Summer Course

**Repo:** [ied-cardesign](https://github.com/tjaditya/ied-cardesign)

In summer 2025, I attended a **3-week onsite car design course at Istituto Europeo di Design (IED), Turin**.  
The program focused on the complete workflow of exterior car design – from initial sketches to a 3D model.

**Course highlights**

- Studio sessions on proportions, stance, and surface language  
- Sketching iterations with one-to-one feedback  
- Translating the selected concept into a 3D physical model using clay modeling 
- Classroom sessions on trends in automotive design

**What I did**

- Developed an original exterior concept for a compact performance car  
- Created side, front, and rear views exploring different surface treatments
- Built a digital version of the chosen concept in Photoshop 
- Built a clay model based on the final sketch using the course tools and workflow  
- Presented the final design to faculty and peers at the end of the program

### 3. Raspberry Pi Autonomous Rover *(in progress)*
**Repo (planned):** `raspi-rover` (coming soon)

Implementing:

- Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)
- Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
- Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)

Focus areas: sensor fusion, control algorithms, and robust embedded software.

### 4. CFD Pipeline for Car Aerodynamics *(in progress)*

- Rebuilding the car design at IED, Turin in Blender as a **clean, watertight 3D model**  
- Preparing the model for **CFD analysis** and 3D printing  
- Running aerodynamic simulations using **cfMesh + OpenFOAM + ParaView**  
- Documenting the full pipeline (concept → 3D → CFD → prototype) in the GitHub repo

**What I learnt**

- Blender modelling → mesh generation using **cfMesh**
- Simulation with **OpenFOAM**
- Post-processing in **ParaView**

Will include: scenarios, meshes, simulation cases, and comparison plots.

More projects and detailed writeups will be added over time.
